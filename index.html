            <h2>Why? Who? How?</h2>
            <p>I am a whistleblower in the crypto casino industry. For a number of years, the owners of Rollbit have been blackmailing me and threatening me using information obtained by placing a bounty on me. Their group has threatened to put me in prison for crimes I did not commit, has falsely implicated me in horrific crimes, and are known for sharing completely faked screenshots to mass audiences. After I was first blackmailed in 2023, I stopped posting about Rollbit. However, the harassment has started up again this month, this time coupled with outright doxxing, threats of arson, and several other forms of illegal harassment.</p>
            <p>Due to these attacks, I will now in my private capacity reopen my journalistic investigation into Rollbit and their long history of criminal activity. I will release parts in chunks. New parts and actions will be released as and when the doxxing and harassment is scaled up. I hope this deters Rollbit from continuing to put the lives of my family in danger, although it probably won’t.</p>

          <h2>Part 1: Diamonds are a man’s best friend</h2>
          <p>In Rollbit’s criminal enterprise, you’ll see an overarching theme – extremely sophisticated schemes designed to dupe people using advanced subterfuge. Their schemes are often non-obvious – such as with their token – which is why they work so well. Normies fall for it.</p>
          <p>However, this wasn’t always the case. The Rollbit team’s earliest known foray into the crypto gambling world brought forward similar teams, indicating where they started their journey of criminality and fraud. But they were younger, and it was done in a more sloppy way, making it much more overt than the rest of their scams.</p>
          <p>CSGODiamonds was a skin gambling site that allowed users to deposit CSGO “skins” (cosmetic weapon items) and use them as currency to bet on roulette, coinflip, dice, and other games. Skins could then be sold for real money on marketplaces, functionally turning them into chips in an unregulated casino economy. CSGODiamonds marketed itself as “provably fair”, emphasizing that outcomes were pre-committed via cryptographic hashes so players could verify the randomness of each roll after the fact.</p>
          <p>CSGODiamonds approached a popular streamer named Mohamad “m0E” Assad to sponsor him: he would gamble live on their site, and in return they gave him shares in the company plus money to gamble with. After a brutal fallout over money and streaming obligations, m0E threatened to expose CSGODiamonds.</p>
          <p>In response, on 13 June 2016, CSGODiamonds published a long statement that included several critical admissions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>They acknowledged that they could see future rolls in advance</li>
            <li>They admitted that they told m0E some of his upcoming roll results ahead of time (so that the stream could be rigged in his favor and make CSGODiamonds look more profitable to players)</li>
            <li>They admitted this happened in both directions – sometimes they proactively gave him future rolls, sometimes he asked for the next result while on stream.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In short, CSGODiamonds rigged the performance of the game for marketing purposes, making it seem more profitable to users than it actually was and abusing the trust of the provably fair system. This is blatant fraud. It’s also a good insight into how these people think – they are rotten people to the core. But their schemes in the future, as we dig in, only became more sophisticated over time.</p>
          <p>So we are able to establish with clear facts and a line of evidence that the Rollbit group’s first known major venture, CSGODiamonds, ended up having a fake provably fair scheme, rigged rolls for a streamer, fraudulent marketing – proven lies and deception.</p>
          <p>In what form precisely will their next scams come? To be written.</p>
